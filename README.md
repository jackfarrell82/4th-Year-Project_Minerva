# CA400 Project Repo: Minerva

> Jack Farrell & Gareth Hogan

## Our System

Our system is a chatbot called Minerva. Minerva is designed to be a chatbot solution that helps new and nontechnical users access and retrieve data from large relational databases without the need for SQL or database knowledge. Minerva uses natural language and translation technology to communicate with the user and then translate their queries into SQL to be used on the database.
